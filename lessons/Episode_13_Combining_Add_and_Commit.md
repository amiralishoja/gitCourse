# Episode 13: Combining Add and Commit

- Use `git commit -am "message"` to stage and commit all modified files in one step, instead of using `git add` and `git commit -m "message"` separately.
- Point is it's `git commit -am "message"` doesn't add untrack files in to stage, fot those you should use `git add`
