# Episode 46: Connecting to GitHub

- Commands:
  - `git remote add <remote-name> <repository-link>`: Connects the local repository to a GitHub repository (default remote name is `origin`).
  - `git branch -M <new-branch-name>`: Renames the main branch (e.g., from `master` to `main`, as `main` is the default on GitHub).
  - `git push -u <remote-name> <branch-name>`: Pushes the local repository to GitHub and sets the upstream branch.
