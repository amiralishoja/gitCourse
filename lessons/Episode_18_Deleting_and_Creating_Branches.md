# Episode 18: Deleting and Creating Branches

- Commands:
  - `git branch -d <branch-name>`: Deletes a branch (works only if the branch is merged).
  - `git branch -D <branch-name>`: Forcefully deletes a branch, even if unmerged.
  - `git branch -c <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch and switches to it.
- Note: You cannot delete the branch you are currently on.
