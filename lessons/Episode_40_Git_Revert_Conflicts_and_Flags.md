# Episode 40: Git Revert Conflicts and Flags

- Reverting past commits may cause conflicts if later commits depend on the reverted changes.
- Conflicts occur if the reverted file no longer exists.
- Flags:
  - `--no-edit`: Reverts without allowing edits to the commit message.
  - `--edit`: Allows editing the revert commit message.
